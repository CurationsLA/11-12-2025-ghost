**The CurationsLA Christmas and Holiday Guide to Venice Beach**

## Introduction

Venice Beach celebrates the holidays with palm trees draped in lights and a laid-back, bohemian vibe that makes Christmas feel uniquely Californian. The famed Venice Canals become a centerpiece of festive magic as residents decorate bridges and kayaks for the annual boat parade, creating an enchanting evening spectacle that draws visitors from across Los Angeles (venicebeachhouse.com). 

Along the iconic boardwalk, street performers incorporate holiday themes into their acts, while shoppers browse local vendors for handmade gifts and artisan crafts. The neighborhood's creative spirit shines during the winter season, with the Venice Winter Fest and holiday sign lighting bringing the community together for celebration (business.venicechamber.net).

With mild winter weather, stunning sunsets over the Pacific, and Abbot Kinney Boulevard's eclectic boutiques staying open for holiday shopping, Venice offers a perfect blend of beachside relaxation and festive cheer. This is where you can ice your coffee in December and still feel the holiday magic in the salt air and twinkling lights along the canals.

**Insider Tip:** The best time to visit the Venice Canals during the holidays is just after sunset, when the decorated houses and bridges light up, creating magical reflections on the water. Park near Washington Boulevard and walk along the canal paths for the most photogenic views.

## Takeaway

Venice Beach's holiday season delivers a uniquely Southern California blend of beachside bohemia and festive celebration. From light-filled canal boat parades to Abbot Kinney's boutique shopping and rooftop sunset cocktails, this neighborhood proves you don't need snow to feel the holiday spirit. 

**Pack smart:** Layers for temperature shifts between beach and evening, comfortable walking shoes for boardwalk and canal strolls, sunglasses even in December, and a reusable water bottle for staying hydrated during market browsing.

**Pro tip:** Combine your visit with the Marina del Rey boat parade (December 13) and Venice Canals parade (mid-December) for maximum holiday spectacle. Park once near Washington Boulevard and you can walk between both locations. The magic hour in Venice during the holidays is sunset (around 5pm in December) when the golden light hits the canals and the holiday lights begin to glow.

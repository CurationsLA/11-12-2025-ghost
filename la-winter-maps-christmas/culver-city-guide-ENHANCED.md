## Introduction

Culver City transforms into a pedestrian-friendly holiday destination where art galleries, indie boutiques, and farm-to-table restaurants create sophisticated yet accessible celebration. The annual Tree Lighting Sled-tacular (Thursday, December 4, 2025, 5:00pm-8:30pm) brings 50 TONS of fresh snow for sledding, carnival games, a 30-minute ceremony featuring 250 local students, a 25-foot holiday tree lighting countdown led by the Mayor, Santa's first Culver City appearance of the season, and free popcorn and hot chocolate—all completely FREE to the public with live-streaming available (downtownculvercity.com).

Once known as the "Heart of Screenland" for historic film studios, this walkable downtown now hosts Sony Pictures Studios while nurturing a thriving arts scene centered around the Culver City Arts District and Platform shopping complex. During holidays, tree-lined streets sparkle with lights, the Culver Steps become gathering places for community events, and local businesses showcase seasonal displays reflecting the neighborhood's creative spirit (visitculvercity.com).

With award-winning restaurants (Vespertine, Margot, Destroyer), contemporary art spaces, and genuine small-town vibe despite its LA County location, Culver City offers refined holiday experiences perfect for food lovers and culture seekers.

**Insider Tip:** Pre-register for free sledding wristbands at downtownculvercity.com before the Tree Lighting event (Dec 4). Visit Gjusta Goods for breakfast, then shop Platform mid-morning before crowds. Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook offers panoramic LA views—best in crisp winter morning light.

## Introduction

Burbank embraces the holidays with the warmth of a small town and the star power of a studio capital. Home to Warner Bros., Disney Studios, and other entertainment giants, this city of 100,000 offers a unique holiday experience where soundstages and backlots become festive backdrops for community celebrations. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood presents "Holidays Made Here" (December 18, 2025 - January 4, 2026) featuring an immersive Gilmore Girls 25th anniversary celebration where Stars Hollow springs to life with authentic holiday detail, nightly light shows, cookie decorating, carolers, and daily appearances by Scott Patterson (Luke Danes) (wbstudiotour.com).

Downtown Burbank and Magnolia Park districts transform with twinkling lights, a 36-foot Christmas tree, and seasonal window displays at locally owned shops that invite leisurely browsing. The Winter Arts Festival (December 13-14) brings vendors, food trucks, and live music to downtown streets (dtnbur.com). The mild winter weather makes outdoor events accessible, from tree lightings to holiday markets, while family-friendly dining—from Porto's legendary Cuban pastries to Castaway's panoramic valley views—caters to visitors seeking that classic California Christmas vibe.

**Insider Tip:** Warner Bros "Holidays Made Here" tours (Dec 18-Jan 4) sell out quickly—book as soon as tickets release. Visit Porto's Bakery Burbank location (3614 W Magnolia Blvd) mid-afternoon (2-4pm) to avoid morning and lunch rush lines. For sunset cocktails with valley views, Castaway Burbank in the Verdugo Mountains is unbeatable.

## Introduction

Long Beach celebrates the holidays with maritime traditions and beachside charm, creating a unique Southern California Christmas experience where harbor lights meet Pacific waves. This diverse waterfront city hosts one of the region's most spectacular boat parades—the Naples Christmas Boat Parade on December 13, 2025, with theme "A Tropical Winter Wonderland"—where dozens of decorated vessels cruise through Alamitos Bay and Naples Canals creating nighttime magic visible from multiple shoreline locations (lbboatparade.com).

The historic Queen Mary, permanently docked in Long Beach Harbor, offers holiday programming [TEMPLATE: verify 2025 specific events - CHILL discontinued, check for replacement holiday experience] (queenmary.com). Downtown Long Beach transforms with holiday markets and tree lighting ceremonies, while neighborhoods like Retro Row on 4th Street, Belmont Shore's 2nd Street, and Naples Island each contribute distinctive character to the city's festive season (visitlongbeach.com).

With mild coastal weather making outdoor celebrations accessible year-round, an urban downtown, classic beach communities, and working waterfront all in one place, Long Beach offers versatile holiday experiences for visitors seeking both relaxation and celebration.

**Insider Tip:** For Naples Boat Parade (Dec 13), arrive early and park at Mother's Beach or Alamitos Bay Marina. Best viewing spots are 2nd Street Bridge, Appian Way Bridge, and walks along the canals. Weekday visits to Retro Row offer easier parking and browsing than weekends.

## Takeaway

Long Beach's holiday season delivers authentic maritime charm with California accessibility—from boat parades illuminating the harbor to waterfront dining and diverse neighborhood shopping. The Naples Canals transform into a twinkling wonderland during the December 13 boat parade, while Retro Row offers vintage treasures you won't find anywhere else.

**Pack smart:** Layers for cool harbor breezes (waterfront is always 5-10°F cooler than inland), comfortable walking shoes for canal strolls and downtown exploration, light jacket for evening boat parade viewing, and reusable shopping bag for Retro Row finds.

**Pro tip:** Combine Naples Boat Parade viewing (Dec 13 evening) with afternoon shopping on Belmont Shore's 2nd Street, dinner at Nick's on 2nd for harbor views, then walk to viewing spots along the canals. Stay for the parade, then head to Retro Row bars for post-parade drinks. Locals park at Mother's Beach early and walk to best viewing spots.

**Long Beach vs. Santa Monica/Venice:** Where Santa Monica offers family-friendly tourism and Venice delivers bohemia, Long Beach provides authentic California port city character—working waterfront meets beach town, urban downtown meets neighborhood charm, and maritime history meets modern culture. Less pretentious, more real.

# CurationsLA Holiday Guide 2025 – Illustration System

This folder curates the unified illustration system brief for the CurationsLA Holiday Guide 2025 across ten Los Angeles neighborhoods. It consolidates the global style rules, shared motifs, neighborhood assignments, and required module outputs so that designers can build production-ready assets that stay consistent with the "CurationsLA Brutalist Geometric" aesthetic.

## File Naming Convention
Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames beginning with `curationsla_`, followed by the neighborhood and module descriptor, e.g., `curationsla_beverly-hills_skyline-celebration_poster.svg`. Keep exports high-resolution and organized into subfolders by neighborhood.

## Production Notes
- Maintain the heavy uniform stroke weight across all compositions.
- Ensure type treatment uses the approved wording ("CurationsLA", "Holiday 2025", etc.).
- Keep all shapes flat without gradients or shadows.
- Repeat motifs strategically for cohesion—nutcrackers, palms, strand lights, and gifts should echo across deliverables.
- Double-check spellings of neighborhoods and destinations before finalizing exports.

Refer to the per-neighborhood briefs in this directory for asset-specific callouts and planned icon categories.
